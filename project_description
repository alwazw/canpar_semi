
this project aims at having a 
1- csv export of bb orders "orders.csv" to get transformed into a canpar input create shipments format via
2- " 0. BB_to_Canpar.py" script the generates "Canpar_Import_Orders.csv"
3- "Canpar_Import_Orders.csv" is experiencing issues parsing text to data as yyyymmdd no matter how i modified its format
4- as this is a poc i am willing to import this file manually into their canshipws tool and semi manually generate labels 
--> alternatively as this keeps failing it might be a better option to skip this bandaid patch option and immediatly proceed to leverage the canpar api to create labels. attached are the manifest generated files as well the xml documentation i was able to find.
5- api response is supposed to retrieve and save both: xml reply with data as well as pdf shipping labels.
6- this test includes 16 orders awaiting shipment. therefore there should be 16 labels generated and saved in the same directory.
